# Udacity_Inventory_App
This repository has been created to version control my inventory applicaiton intended to be submitted. Project is for Udacity's "Android Basics Nanaodegree by Google" nanodegree program. This project is number 11/11.

# Project Overview (From Udacity)
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app to track a store's inventory.

The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

# What will I Iearn? (From Udacity)
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

    Storing information in a SQLite database
    Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
    Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
    Updating information based on user input.
    Creating intents to other apps using stored information.
