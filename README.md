# Udacity_Inventory_App
This repository has been created to version control my inventory applicaiton intended to be submitted. Project is for Udacity's "Android Basics Nanaodegree by Google" nanodegree program. This project is number 11/11.

# Project Overview (From Udacity)
This project is a chance for you to combine and practice everything you learned in this section of the Nanodegree program. You will be making an app to track a store's inventory.

The goal is to design and create the structure of an Inventory App which would allow a store to keep track of its inventory of products. The app will need to store information about price, quantity available, supplier, and a picture of the product. It will also need to allow the user to track sales and shipments and make it easy for the user to order more from the listed supplier.

# What will I Iearn? (From Udacity)
This project is about combining various ideas and skills we’ve been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Storing information in a SQLite database
- Integrating Android’s file storage systems into that database
- Presenting information from files and SQLite databases to users
- Updating information based on user input.
- Creating intents to other apps using stored information.

### Layout ###
CRITERIA | MEETS SPECIFICATIONS
---------|-----------------------
Overall Layout |  The app contains a list of current products and a button to add a new product.
List item layout | Each ListItem displays the product name, current quantity, and price. Each list item also allows the user to track a sale of the item
Detail layout | The detail layout for each item displays the remainder of the information stored in the database. The detail layout contains buttons to modify the current quantity either by tracking a sale or by receiving a shipment.The detail layout contains a button to order from the supplier. The detail view contains a button to delete the product record entirely.
Layout Best Practices | The code adheres to all of the following best practices: <ul><li>Text sizes are defined in sp</li><li>Lengths are defined in dp</li><li>Padding and margin is used appropriately, such that the views are not crammed up against each other.</li></ul>
Default Textview | When there is no information to display in the database, the layout displays a TextView with instructions on how to populate the database.
